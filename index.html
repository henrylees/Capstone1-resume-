    <h2>Educaction</h2>
    <p>I learned everything I know related to programming and web development from online videos, I'm basically a self taught developer.</p>
    <p>These are the places where I've learned from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>YouTube. Especially from the channel called "Bro Code", That guy is a beast at teaching.</li>
        <li>Udemy. Web development course of Angela Yu.</li>
        <li>I belive that is everything, but I'll leave this item here anyway</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>I've worked a lot and learned a lot along the way, but so far nothing related to web development yet, so I'm not gonna put any information here yet.</p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Master in communication, I'm very good at communicating my message.</li>
        <li>Problem solving mastery, I didn't know I had this skill until recently I see everybody struggles with "problems" that I can see the solution for from miles away.</li>
        <li>Teachable, I'm open to learn, which makes me a person that can learn faster than most.</li>
